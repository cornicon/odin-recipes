# odin-recipes
Recipe website tutorial from the Project Odin to create a simple recipe website. I am just learning how to use html and css.

All of the recipes and images that I used were from <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">. I may have modified the recipes slightly but that is where I got the base content. Thank you allrecipes.com

I hope to learn various skills while setting up this recipe website
including HTML and Git workflow. The odin project is a full stack programming learning project and so far it has had some really good material. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/"> Thank you to the many people who contributed to the course material.
